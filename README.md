## System Overview

GearGuard is a React-based single-page application (SPA) designed to streamline maintenance operations within industrial and corporate environments. The system implements a role-based access control (RBAC) architecture, facilitating distinct operational views for Managers, Technicians, and Employees. It utilizes a mock backend service to simulate data persistence and API latency, ensuring a realistic user experience during development and testing phases.

**Key Objectives:**
*   Minimize equipment downtime through efficient request tracking.
*   Optimize technician resource allocation.
*   Provide real-time visibility into asset health and maintenance status.

## Technical Architecture

The application is constructed using a modern frontend stack, prioritizing performance, type safety, and component modularity.

### Core Stack
*   **Runtime Environment:** Node.js (Development)
*   **Framework:** React 18 (Concurrent Mode enabled)
*   **Build Tool:** Vite (ESModule optimized)
*   **Language:** TypeScript (Strict mode compliance)
*   **Styling Engine:** Tailwind CSS (Utility-first methodology)
*   **Routing:** React Router v6 (Client-side routing)
*   **Icons:** Lucide React (SVG-based)

### Data Simulation
*   **Service Layer:** `mockBackend.ts`
*   **Persistence Strategy:** `localStorage` (Browser-based ephemeral storage)
*   **Latency Simulation:** `delay()` function (500ms jitter)

## Feature Matrix

### 1. Authentication Module
*   **Algorithm:** Custom validation logic with regex enforcement.
*   **Constraints:** Password complexity (Min 8 chars, 1 uppercase, 1 lowercase, 1 special char).
*   **Demo Bypass:** Hardcoded credentials available for rapid prototyping.

### 2. Dashboard Analytics (Manager Role)
*   **KPI Visualization:**
    *   *Critical Equipment:* Red indicator (Health < 30%).
    *   *Active Load:* Green indicator (Pending + Overdue requests).
    *   *Resource Utilization:* Blue indicator (% Technicians booked).
*   **Workflow Visualization:** Interactive Kanban board (Drag-and-Drop enabled).

### 3. Technician Workspace
*   **Task Management:** Split-view interface (Available vs. Assigned).
*   **Temporal Visualization:**
    *   *Monthly View:* Heatmap-style calendar.
    *   *Daily View:* 24-hour timeline with task block rendering.

### 4. Asset Management
*   **Inventory Tracking:** Comprehensive equipment list with health metrics.
*   **Contextual Organization:** Grouping by Work Center, Department, or Assigned Employee.
*   **Lifecycle Management:** Status tracking (Active/Scrapped) with integrated logic hooks.
*   **Smart Interactions:** "Odoo-style" maintenance history button on asset detail views.
